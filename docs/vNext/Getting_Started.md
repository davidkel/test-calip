## Caliper Introduction

Caliper is a blockchain performance benchmark framework, which allows users to test different blockchain solutions with predefined use cases, and get a set of performance test results.

**Currently supported blockchain solutions:**
* [Hyperledger Burrow](https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow)
* [Hyperledger Composer](https://github.com/hyperledger/composer)
* [Hyperledger Fabric](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric)
* [Hyperledger Iroha](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha)
* [Hyperledger Sawtooth](https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core)

Steps for configuring a benchmark that targets a supported blockchain technology are given in the following pages:

- [Burrow](./Burrow_Configuration.md)
- [Composer](./Composer_Configuration.md)
- [Fabric](./Fabric_Configuration.md)
- [Iroha](./Iroha_Configuration.md)
- [Sawtooth](./Sawtooth_Configuration.md)

<br>

**Currently supported performance indicators:**
* Success rate
* Transaction/Read throughput
* Transaction/Read latency(minimum, maximum, average, percentile)
* Resource consumption (CPU, Memory, Network IO,...)

See [PSWG](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/pswg/performance-and-scale-wg) to find out the definitions and corresponding measurement methods.  

## Architecture
See the [Architecture Introduction](./Architecture.md) page.

## Installing Caliper
See the [Installing and Running Caliper](./Installing_Caliper.md) page.

## Caliper Flow Control

The default Caliper lifecycle is:
- Start SUT (using a `start` command in the network configuration file)
- Initialize the SUT
- Install smart contracts
- Perform the benchmark test
- Tear down SUT (using an `end` command in the network configuration file)

In some cases it is desirable to run a subset of the complete Caliper lifecycle. It is possible to do this by using command line flags:

To skip a phase:
- `caliper-flow-skip-start` skip the start command within the network configuration file
- `caliper-flow-skip-init` skip the blockchain init() function that is used to configure an existing blockchain network
- `caliper-flow-skip-install` skip the installation of any smart contracts listed in the network configuration file
- `caliper-flow-skip-test` skip the benchmark test
- `caliper-flow-skip-end` skip the end command within the network configuration file

One or more `skip` flags may be specified at a time, but may not be used in conjunction with `only` flags.

To only run a single phase:
- `caliper-flow-only-start` only run the start command within the network configuration file
- `caliper-flow-only-init` only run the blockchain init() function that is used to configure an existing blockchain network
- `caliper-flow-only-install` only install the smart contracts listed in the network configuration file
- `caliper-flow-only-test` only run the benchmark test
- `caliper-flow-only-end` only run the end command within the network configuration file

Only one `only` flag is permitted to be supplied at a time, and may not be used in conjuction with a `skip` flag. For instance, given that a blockchain network has been created, configured and has smart contracts installed, to run the benchmark test, the following command would be used:

```bash
caliper benchmark run --caliper-workspace ./packages/caliper-samples --caliper-benchconfig benchmark/simple/config.yaml --caliper-networkconfig network/fabric-v1.4/2org1peercouchdb/fabric-node.yaml --caliper-flow-only-test
```

## Run Benchmark with Distributed Clients (Experimental)

In this way, multiple clients can be launched on distributed hosts to run the same benchmark.

1. Start the ZooKeeper service using the Caliper CLI: 
```bash
caliper zooservice start
```
2. Launch a caliper-zoo-client on each target machine using the Caliper CLI:
```bash
caliper zooclient start -w ~/myCaliperProject -a <host-address>:<port>  -n my-sut-config.yaml
```

3. Modify the client type setting in configuration file to 'zookeeper'.

    Example:
    ```
    "clients": {
      "type": "zookeeper",
      "zoo" : {
        "server": "10.229.42.159:2181",
        "clientsPerHost": 5
      }
    }
    ```

4. Launch the benchmark on any machine as usual.

> Note:
> * Zookeeper is used to register clients and exchange messages. A launched client will add a new znode under /caliper/clients/. The benchmark checks the directory to learn how many clients are there, and assign tasks to each client according to the workload.
> * There is no automatic time synchronization between the clients. You should manually synchronize time between target machines, for example using 'ntpdate'.
> * The blockchain configuration file must exist on machines which run the client, and the relative path (relative to the caliper folder) of the file must be identical. All referenced files in the configuration must also exist.
