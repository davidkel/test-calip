## Caliper Introduction

Caliper is a blockchain performance benchmark framework, which allows users to test different blockchain solutions with predefined use cases, and get a set of performance test results.

**Currently supported blockchain solutions:**
* [Hyperledger Fabric](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric)
* [Hyperledger Sawtooth](https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core)
* [Hyperledger Iroha](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha)
* [Hyperledger Composer](https://github.com/hyperledger/composer)

<br>

**Currently supported performance indicators:**
* Success rate
* Transaction/Read throughput
* Transaction/Read latency(minimum, maximum, average, percentile)
* Resource consumption (CPU, Memory, Network IO,...)

See [PSWG](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/pswg/performance-and-scale-wg) to find out the definitions and corresponding measurement methods.  

## Achitecture
See [Architecture Introduction]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/2_Architecture.md %}).

## Pre-requisites

Make sure following tools are installed
* NodeJS 8.X
* node-gyp
* Docker
* Docker-compose

### Install blockchain SDKs

Run `npm install` in Caliper folder to install dependencies locally, the relevant packages for the Hyperledger projects must be installed to use those plugins. You can find information in the pages below.

- [Fabric]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/Fabric_Configuration.md %})
- [Sawtooth]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/Sawtooth_configuration.md %})
- [Iroha]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/Iroha_configuration.md %})
- [Composer]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/Composer_Configuration.md %})

## Run benchmark

All predefined benchmarks can be found in [*benchmark*](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/tree/master/benchmark) folder.
To start your first benchmark, just run this in root folder
```bash
node benchmark/simple/main.js -c yourconfig.json -n yournetwork.json
```
* -c : specify the config file of the benchmark, if not used,  *config.json* will be used as default.
* -n : specify the config file of the blockchain network under test. If not used, the file address must be specified in the benchmak config file.

Some example SUTs are provided in [*network*](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/tree/master/network) folder, they can be launched automatically before the test by setting the bootstrap commands in the configuration file, e.g
```json
{
  "command" : {
    "start": "docker-compose -f network/fabric/simplenetwork/docker-compose.yaml up -d",
    "end" : "docker-compose -f network/fabric/simplenetwork/docker-compose.yaml down;docker rm $(docker ps -aq)"
  }
}
```
The scripts defined in *command.start* will be called before the test, and the scripts defined in *command.end* will be called after the finish of all tests. You can use them to define any preparation or clean-up works.  

You can also run the test with your own blockchain network, a network configuration should be provided and corresponding file path should be specified in  configuration file's *blockchain.config*.

> Note:
> * When running the benchmark, one or more blockchain clients will be used to generate and submit transactions to the SUT. The number of launched clients as well as testing workload can be defined using the [configuration file]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/2_Architecture.md %}).  
> * A HTML report will be generated automatically after the testing.

### Alternative

You can also use npm scripts to run a benchmark.
* npm run list: list all available benchmarks

```bash
$ npm run list

> caliper@0.1.0 list /home/hurf/caliper
> node ./scripts/list.js

Available benchmarks:
drm
simple
```

* npm test: run a benchmark with specific config files

```bash
$ npm test -- simple -c ./benchmark/simple/config.json -n ./benchmark/simple/fabric.json

> caliper@0.1.0 test /home/hurf/caliper
> node ./scripts/test.js "simple" "-c" "./benchmark/simple/config.json" "-n" "./benchmark/simple/fabric.json"
......
```

## Run benchmark with distributed clients (experimental)

In this way, multiple clients can be launched on distributed hosts to run the same benchmark.

1. Start the ZooKeeper service
2. Launch clients on target machines separately by running `node ./src/comm/client/zoo-client.js zookeeper-server` or `npm run startclient -- zookeeper-server` . Time synchronization between target machines should be executed before launching the clients.  

    Example:
    ```bash
    $ npm run startclient -- 10.229.42.159:2181

    > caliper@0.1.0 startclient /home/hurf/caliper
    > node ./src/comm/client/zoo-client.js "10.229.42.159:2181"

    Connected to ZooKeeper
    Created client node:/caliper/clients/client_1514532063571_0000000006
    Created receiving queue at:/caliper/client_1514532063571_0000000006_in
    Created sending queue at:/caliper/client_1514532063571_0000000006_out
    Waiting for messages at:/caliper/client_1514532063571_0000000006_in......
    ```
3. Modify the client type setting in configuration file to 'zookeeper'.

    Example:
    ```
    "clients": {
      "type": "zookeeper",
      "zoo" : {
        "server": "10.229.42.159:2181",
        "clientsPerHost": 5
      }
    }
    ```

4. Launch the benchmark on any machine as usual.

> Note:
> * Zookeeper is used to register clients and exchange messages. A launched client will add a new znode under /caliper/clients/. The benchmark checks the directory to learn how many clients are there, and assign tasks to each client according to the workload.
> * There is no automatic time synchronization between the clients. You should manually synchronize time between target machines, for example using 'ntpdate'.
> * The blockchain configuration file must exist on machines which run the client, and the relative path (relative to the caliper folder) of the file must be identical. All referenced files in the configuration must also exist.
